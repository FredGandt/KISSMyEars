# KISSMyEars

"[Keep It Stupid Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)" local audio file player Chrome extension, **CURRENTLY IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT** and likely to contain much incomplete or flat out broken code and functionality.

## Why?
Having tried many local music players, on Windoze and Linux, I have frequently been confused, frustrated and disappointed. Entire forums have been dedicated to assisting users of these players in operating them. I just want to play my music archive in *all the most reasonably expected ways*; press "go" and music happens :)

## Premise
 * I am using a PC, unsurprisingly already have a web browser installed and it's open practically all the time
 * I have my music archive ripped and stored on my PC in directories
 * I want to play those files in specific or shuffled orders
 * I don't want my music player to:
   * require the internet or alter my files at all
   * have so many optional extra features that it requires an online wiki or forum to comprehend
   * utilise deep learning AI, and via a wet wired BCI, examine my mood and make selections it deems suitable

With this premise in mind, I am working to build a Chrome web browser extension that provides **only** the features I **need** and presents them in a one stop control panel.

## Devlopment
I haven't even finished building it yet and it's already, by far, the most satisfying music player I have used, but there is still a lot of coding to do.
Feel free to try it out as an unpackaged extension while I work on it, and I will publish it on the Chrome Web Store when it's in a fit state for simpler installation.
